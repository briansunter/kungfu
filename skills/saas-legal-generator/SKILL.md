description: Create an attorney-review-ready SaaS legal drafting package from an evidence-based data and product inventory. Use whenever the user needs a privacy notice, terms of service, cookie notice, acceptable use policy, DPA, CCPA/CPRA notice, vendor disclosure, or a gap analysis of existing legal pages. This skill flags issues and drafts language; it never guarantees legal compliance.

# SaaS Legal Drafting Assistant

Generate tailored drafts and an issue list for professional review. Laws,
thresholds, contracts, and enforcement guidance change. This skill provides
information and drafting support—not legal advice, legal representation, or a
compliance certification.

## Hard Rules

- Never describe generated documents as “legally compliant,” “complete,” or
  universally required.
- Use current official legal and regulatory sources for every selected
  jurisdiction.
- Do not infer legal entity name, address, governing law, dispute forum, age
  eligibility, retention period, lawful basis, data sale/sharing, or contact
  details.
- Distinguish the service’s role as controller/business, processor/service
  provider, or both by processing activity.
- The published notice must match actual code, vendors, contracts, and
  operations. Policy text cannot repair a noncompliant product flow.
- Do not deploy nonessential cookies or tracking merely because a banner exists.
  Where consent is required, block the relevant technology until valid choice is
  obtained and preserve withdrawal.
- Do not add a California “Do Not Sell or Share” link or claim CCPA
  applicability without assessing coverage and practices. Covered businesses
  must also process applicable opt-out preference signals such as Global Privacy
  Control.
- Require qualified counsel review for launch, material data changes, regulated
  data, children, biometrics, AI profiling, international transfers, enterprise
  DPAs, or disputes.

## Start With a Legal Data Map

Inspect the repository, infrastructure, website, app stores, analytics, payment,
email, support, and auth integrations. Then confirm:

- legal entity, trade names, addresses, and contacts;
- service, users, countries, and age restrictions;
- data categories, sources, purposes, and recipients;
- processing roles and lawful bases where relevant;
- cookies, pixels, SDKs, local storage, and consent behavior;
- vendors/subprocessors and processing locations;
- retention rules and deletion mechanics;
- user rights request, appeal, verification, and opt-out workflows;
- security controls and incident process;
- billing, renewals, refunds, trials, and cancellation;
- user content, IP licenses, acceptable use, suspension, and termination;
- governing law, dispute approach, and contract hierarchy;
- regulated data or sector-specific requirements.

Label each item `Verified in product`, `User confirmed`, `Assumption`, or
`Unknown`.

## Determine Scope Before Drafting

Create a jurisdiction/obligation matrix rather than automatically adding every
law:

| Question | Evidence needed |
| --- | --- |
| Which privacy laws may apply? | Entity, location, targeting, thresholds, data practices |
| Is consent required for a technology? | Purpose, device access, jurisdiction, exemption |
| Is the company selling/sharing data? | Contract and data-flow analysis, not marketing labels |
| Is a DPA needed? | Controller/processor relationship and customer contract |
| Are transfer terms needed? | Origin, destination, mechanism, vendor contracts |
| Are children involved? | Actual audience, age gates, knowledge, and product design |
| Are accessibility/local-language duties relevant? | Market and service context |

Escalate uncertain threshold or conflict-of-law questions to counsel instead of
guessing.

## Drafting Workflow

### 1. Create the Configuration

Use [`example_config.json`](example_config.json) as a starting point. Preserve
unknown fields as explicit placeholders; do not silently choose defaults with
legal effect.

### 2. Generate a Baseline

```bash
cd skills/saas-legal-generator
bun run scripts/index.ts
# or
bun run scripts/index.ts config.json
```

[`scripts/index.ts`](scripts/index.ts) accelerates assembly. Its output is a
draft that must be compared with the data map and current law.

### 3. Tailor the Documents

Select only applicable documents:

- [Global privacy policy](templates/privacy-policy-global.md)
- [SaaS terms of service](templates/terms-of-service-saas.md)
- [Cookie policy](templates/cookie-policy.md)
- [Acceptable use policy](templates/acceptable-use-policy.md)
- [Data processing agreement](templates/data-processing-agreement.md)
- [CCPA/CPRA opt-out notice](templates/ccpa-opt-out-link.md)

For each clause attach its source: product behavior, contract term, business
decision, or legal requirement. Do not leave broad “may collect anything”
language when actual practices can be stated precisely.

### 4. Validate Product-to-Policy Consistency

Check:

- every SDK/vendor appears in the relevant disclosure and contract inventory;
- consent and preference changes actually alter data collection;
- deletion/export/request workflows work end to end;
- retention periods match jobs, backups, legal holds, and vendor deletion;
- trial, renewal, refund, and cancellation flows match the terms;
- links are visible before account creation and purchase where appropriate;
- material changes have a notice/versioning plan;
- no critical placeholders remain.

A passive “by continuing you agree” banner is not a valid default for
nonessential cookies where affirmative consent is required.

### 5. Produce Counsel Review Materials

Return both redlines and a concise issue list:

- high-risk unresolved decisions;
- assumptions that counsel must confirm;
- clause alternatives and business trade-offs;
- evidence/source behind each material statement;
- product changes required beyond documents;
- owner and review date;
- change log and effective-date plan.

## Output Contract

Return:

1. disclaimer and scope;
2. verified legal/data inventory;
3. jurisdiction and obligation matrix;
4. missing decisions and counsel triggers;
5. selected draft documents;
6. product-to-policy gap report;
7. implementation checklist for consent, rights, retention, and links;
8. placeholder report and attorney review packet.

Generated examples may be stored in `output/`, but must not be treated as
production-ready.
